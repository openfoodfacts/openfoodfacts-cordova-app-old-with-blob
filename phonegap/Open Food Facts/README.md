# Open Food Facts mobile app (phonegap) #

This app allows to scan products, to see the corresponding product data from http://openfoodfacts.org and to add data and/or pictures on Open Food Facts. 

## Supported systems ##

The app builds and runs on Android phones. It is however developed with Phonegap / Cordova, a platform that allows mobile apps to be coded in HTML and Javascript, and to be built and deployed
to multiple systems. It should therefore be possible to easily adapt it to run on other systems such as iOS and Blackberry. The application requires the "BarcodeScanner" Phonegap plugin
which currently exists for Android, iOS and Blackberry.
